# Bing Maps API

To use the Bing Maps API you need to [create a new developer account](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key#basic). Once you create an account, you would need to create an API key that you can use to authenticate your requests to the API. Save this key in a secure place, DON'T SHARE IT.
