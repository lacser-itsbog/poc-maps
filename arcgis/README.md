# Test: ArcGIS

Try it in [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/lacser-itsbog/poc-maps/tree/main/arcgis/test_arcgis)

## Usage

First you'll need to create a new ArcGIS account and upgrade it to an ArcGIS Developer account. Then, you can create a new API key to start using the APIS.

## Evaluation

### License and cost

TODO: developer license free, individual license starts on 500k COP.

### Usability

TODO

### Performance

We don't know yet the amount of data to show on the map, so we need a library that supports showing data at different scales, ideally in a progressive fashion.

### Support for different formats

TODO
